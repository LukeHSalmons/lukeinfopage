        <h2 class="colour">About Me</h2>

        <p class="colour">My name is Luke Hunter-Salmons and I am a Software Engineering student at HyperionDev with the aim to transition into a career into the tech space. Through this course I have developed a strong understanding of Python as well as experience using SQL, HTML/CSS, Django and Git. I have created a number of projects throughout my course including a finance calculator and an inventory tracker.</p>

        <p class="colour">When I'm not working on personal projects or studying I also work a full-time job as an Accounts/IT Assistant at a company in central London. I am a huge foodie who loves to eat good food and a big advocate for travelling and truly believe experiencing different cultures broadens the mind and inspires creativity. </p>

    <div id="projects-section">
        <h2 class="colour">Projects</h2>

        <p class="colour">I have completed a number of projects, both as part of my course and personally, most of which I share on my <a class="colour" href="http://github.com/LukeHSalmons">Github</a>. These are a few of my personal favourites: </p>

        <h3 class="colour">Finance Calculator - Python</h3>
        <p class="colour">This project was built using Python for the purpose of providing the user with a financial calculator. This calculator allows the user to choose between calculating the interest of an investment over a given number of years or calculate their monthly bond repayment.</p>

        <h3 class="colour">Inventory Tracker - Python</h3>
        <p class="colour">This project was made using Python for the purpose of being an inventory tracking programme for a shoe store where the data is stored in a .txt file. The programme stores details such as country of origin, product code, product name, cost and quantity of each shoe.</p>    

        <h3 class="colour">Password Hacked Checker - Python</h3>
        <p class="colour">This project was also built using Python and is used to check if your password has been leaked using the 'Have I Been Pwned' API. The program is able to read all passwords from a text file, hash them and retreive a list of hash passwords from the website that match the first few digits of your password. The program then compares these hashes on your local machine to your hashed password. The program works this way so the website never sees your full hashed password and your passwords remain secure.</p>
